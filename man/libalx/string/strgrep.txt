NAME
	alx_strlfgrep â€” size-bounded string fgrep on "C" strings

LIBRARY
	Utility functions (libalx-string, -l alx-string)

SYNOPSIS
	#include "libalx/string/strgrep.h"
		or
	#include "libalx/string.h"

	ssize_t alx_strlfgrep(ssize_t buff_size,
					char dest[restrict buff_size],
					const char src[restrict buff_size],
					const char *restrict pattern);

DESCRIPTION
	The 'alx_strlfgrep()' function searches the input string 'str' for
	lines containing a match to the given 'pattern'.  No more than
	'buff_size' characters are searched.  'alx_strlfgrep()' prints the
	matching lines into the provided buffer 'dest'.  It intends to be a
	"C" clone of the program 'fgrep' {a.k.a. 'grep -f'}, but works with
	"C" strings instead of files.  As 'strlcpy' and derivatives, the l
	in the name means that it is designed to work with strings instead
	of non-NUL-terminated buffers.  'alx_strlfgrep()' takes the full
	size of the buffer (not just the length) and guarantees to
	NUL-terminate the result (as long as 'buff_size' is larger than 0).
	Note that a byte for the NUL should be included in 'buff_size'.
	Also note that 'alx_strlfgrep()' only operates on true "C" strings.
	This means that for 'alx_strlfgrep()' both 'src' and 'pattern' must
	be NUL-terminated.
	
	If 'pattern' is not NUL-terminated, the behavior is Undefined.
	If 'src' is not NUL-terminated, 'alx_strlfgrep()' will read exactly
	'buff_size' characters, and the string will be truncated.  The
	resulting string is stored in 'dest' and is NUL-terminated, even
	if 'src' wasn't.

RETURN VALUES
	The 'alx_strlfgrep()' function returns the total length of the
	string it created.  That means the length of 'dest'.

EXAMPLES
	The following code fragment illustrates the simple case:

		char str[BUFSIZ];
		char buf[BUFSIZ];

		...

		(void)alx_strlfgrep(sizeof(buf), buf, str, "Find this!");

BUGS
	If 'pattern' is not NUL-terminated, the behavior is Undefined.
